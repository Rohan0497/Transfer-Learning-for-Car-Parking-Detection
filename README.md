## SSD Object Detection System

This repository contains Python scripts for training, inference, and evaluation of a Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) for object detection tasks. The SSD model is implemented using PyTorch and torchvision, and the code is organized into modular scripts for various tasks including model creation, data handling, training, inference, and evaluation.

### Files

- **config.py**: Configuration file containing hyperparameters and settings.
- **model.py**: Module for creating the SSD model.
- **train.py**: Script for training the SSD model.
- **datasets.py**: Module for creating datasets for training and validation.
- **inference.py**: Module for performing inference with the trained SSD model.
- **eval.py**: Module for evaluating the performance of the trained SSD model.
- **utils.py**: Utility functions for averaging, saving models, and visualizing data.
  

### Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ssd-object-detection.git
cd ssd-object-detection
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run training:

```bash
python train.py
```

4. Run inference:

```bash
python inference.py
```

5. Evaluate model performance:

```bash
python eval.py
```

6. Adjust hyperparameters and settings in `config.py` as needed.

### Configuration (`config.py`)

- **Data Configuration**: Specify data paths, image sizes, and other data-related settings.
- **Model Configuration**: Configure the SSD model architecture, number of classes, and other model-specific parameters.
- **Training Configuration**: Set training hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.

### Results

The scripts generate various outputs including trained model checkpoints, evaluation metrics such as mAP, and visualizations of inference results. Results can be further analyzed and visualized using custom plotting functions provided in the `utils.py` module.
