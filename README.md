Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) Object Detection
This repository contains Python scripts for training and validating an SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector) model for object detection using PyTorch and Torchvision. The code is organized into modular scripts for model creation, training, validation, and visualization of results.

Files
config.py: Configuration file containing hyperparameters and settings.
datasets.py
inference.py
eval.py
model.py: Module for creating the SSD model.
train.py: Script for training the SSD model.
utils.py: Utility functions for data preprocessing, visualization, and model evaluation.
Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ssd-object-detection.git
cd ssd-object-detection
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the training script:

bash
Copy code
python train.py
Adjust hyperparameters and settings in config.py for experimentation.

Configuration (config.py)
Model Configuration:

NUM_CLASSES: Number of classes for object detection.
NUM_EPOCHS: Number of epochs for model training.
LR: Learning rate for optimizer.
MOMENTUM: Momentum value for optimizer.
WEIGHT_DECAY: Weight decay parameter for optimizer.
GAMMA: Gamma value for learning rate scheduler.
STEP_SIZE: Step size for learning rate scheduler.
OUT_DIR: Directory to save the trained model and evaluation results.
VISUALIZE_TRANSFORMED_IMAGES: Boolean flag to visualize transformed images during training.
NUM_WORKERS: Number of workers for data loading.
RESIZE_TO: Size of the input image for training and validation.
VALID_DIR: Directory containing validation data.
TRAIN_DIR: Directory containing training data.
RESOLUTION_SCHEDULE: Schedule for changing resolution during training.
Results
The training script saves the best model based on validation mAP (mean Average Precision) and generates plots for training loss and mAP. Additionally, it prints the training loss and mAP for each epoch. The utility functions in utils.py provide visualization tools for precision-recall curves and confusion matrices.
